## Riddle Game üîé

**Basic Idea:**                                                                                                      
Every riddle that happens here depends on the adventure part of the game. If the person comes across 3 doors in a mansion, it can give them a riddle.
If the person doesn't solve the riddle corecctly, they get an annoying sound until they get a trivia question or a riddle correct. 
If the person gets it correct, the game will "jumpscare" the player with a meme. 

**Interface:**     
There is a question/riddle that appears in the center on the screen. Then it moves to the top of the screen and 4 boxes appear on the bottom of the screen as the answers.

Example:    
Riddle: How many months have 28 days?      
- [X] 12
- [ ] 1
- [ ] 6
- [ ] None

**Scoring:**      
The game starts with 0 points. The player *might* have negative points if they fail hardcore.
If the person finished the riddle under 1 minute, they get the rest of the 1 minute added to their points (in seconds). If the player finishes after 1 minute, the time they take will be subtracted from their total points.

## Reaction Test üòäüôÄüê≥:unicorn:

**Basic Idea:**    
If you lose a question, it won‚Äôt tell you if you are right or wrong, but a random picture would pop up and you have to click on the picture.  

**Scoring:**    
If you get the question wrong, you will lose 60 points. The computer will time how long you take, and it will subtract that amount of time from 60 seconds for you to answer the next question, if you get the question right, the amount of time you had left would be added to your points, if you get it wrong, nothing happens to your points.

**Sound:**    
A weird noise is going to be sounding until you finish answering the question.

If they click before the photo appears, they will only have 45 seconds to answer the next question. After that, the game would go back to an adventure/riddle/trivia game.

## ¬øTrivia Game?

**Basic Idea:**
The computer will generate a question which you have to answer. You type the answer you believe is correct. 

**Scoring:**
If you get the question wrong you will get double the amount of points the question is worth, off from your score. With harder question the more points you will get when you get it right. The questions come with a time limit but the time limit will get longer with the harder questions. If you get the question right the points the question is worth will be added to your score, you start with 0 points.

**Controls:**
The game will randomly generate a question which you have to answer by typing the answer you believe is correct. Do not use caps.  

**Bonus:**
After each question there will be a gigantic crossword puzzle which the the correct answer you just typed in will be somewhere inside. To answer the question you have to type the number on the right first (The layer where the letter is) then type the number on the type second (The column where the letter is). Do NOT add spaces between the numbers.

## Adventure Game ##

**Basic Idea**
Create game where your world and your choices are presented to you in text and you type in text to perform actions.

**How it works**
There will be multiple "scenes" that change whenever you type in where to go. There will also be dfferent ways to win **(maybe)** like finding the exit or getting enough points. You (may or may not) be able to backtrack and go back to previous environmentsand use items you find in each scene with other ones in other scenes.

**Getting Points**
As you go through the world, you will run into puzzles and triva and riddles. Solve them to get points. Might add death/lose function.
